### Car Search Bot (CSB)

Honestly, I'm lazy and need to find a car, so this is going to help me do that. records as a CSV file.

Nifty, right?

You'll need to make -

- car_data.json
- car_data.csv

Make these in the output folder, and it should all work fine.

This is really just a tool that you can use to record any kind of data into two very portable forms of storage. This is to store cars as objects so I can run analysis for cost and price over a large amount of vehicles.


I used a virtual environment, with virtualenv. I suggest you do the same.
