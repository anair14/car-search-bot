### Car Search Bot (CSB)

Honestly, I'm lazy and need to find a car, so this is going to help me do that. records as a CSV file.

Nifty, right?

You'll need to make -

- car_data.json
- car_data.csv

Make these in the output folder, and it should all work fine.

I used a virtual environment, with virtualenv. I suggest you do the same.
